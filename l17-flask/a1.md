Here's an example of how you can create a simple Flask application to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API to perform GET requests to retrieve all users and get a user by their ID. This example uses the `requests` library to make API requests.

1. First, make sure you have Flask and requests installed in your Python environment:

    ```sh
    pip install Flask requests
    ```

2. Create a file named `app.py` with the following content:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

BASE_URL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com'

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

@app.route('/users')
def get_all_users():
    response = requests.get(f'{BASE_URL}/users')
    users = response.json()
    return jsonify(users)

@app.route('/users/<int:user_id>')
def get_user_by_id(user_id):
    response = requests.get(f'{BASE_URL}/users/{user_id}')
    user = response.json()
    return jsonify(user)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

3. Run the Flask application:

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

This application defines two routes:

-   `/users`: This route retrieves all users from the JSONPlaceholder API and returns them as JSON.
-   `/users/<int:user_id>`: This route takes a user ID as a parameter, retrieves the user's data by their ID from the JSONPlaceholder API, and returns the data as JSON.

You can access the routes using your browser or a tool like `curl`. For example:

-   To retrieve all users: http://127.0.0.1:5000/users
-   To retrieve a user by ID: http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/1

Remember that this example is a simple demonstration of interacting with an API using Flask. In a real-world scenario, you might want to handle errors, perform validation, and create more comprehensive routes.
