# Explanation: Dictionaries in Python are collections 
# of key-value pairs. In this example, a dictionary named user
# is created to store user-related information.
# Values are accessed using the keys.


# Creating a dictionary
user = {
    "username": "johndoe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "age": 30
}

# Accessing dictionary values
print("Username:", user["username"])
print("Email:", user["email"])
print("Age:", user["age"])
