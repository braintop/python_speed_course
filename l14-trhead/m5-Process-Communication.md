Explanation of the code:

-Import the multiprocessing module.
-Define the sender function that sends messages through both Queue and Pipe.
-Define the receiver function that receives messages from both Queue and Pipe.
-In the main function:
--Create a Queue for communication between processes.
--Create a Pipe with two ends (parent and child connections) for communication between processes.
--Create sender and receiver processes, passing the Queue and Pipe objects.
--Start both sender and receiver processes.
--Use the join method to wait for both processes to finish.

When you run this code, you'll see that messages are exchanged between processes using both the multiprocessing.Queue and multiprocessing.Pipe mechanisms. These mechanisms provide a way for different processes to communicate and share data in a multiprocessing environment.
