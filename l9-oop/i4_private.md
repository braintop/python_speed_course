In Python, access control modifiers like private, public, and protected are implemented slightly differently compared to Java. Here's an explanation of how these access control modifiers work in Python, with comparisons to Java:

### Public, Private, and Protected Access Modifiers in Python (Relating to Java)

#### Public Access (No Modifier):

In both Python and Java, by default, class members are public. This means they can be accessed from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public_var = "This is public"

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.public_var)  # Accessing public_var
```

#### Private Access (Name Mangling):

-   In Python, private members are indicated by using a double underscore `__` prefix before the variable or method name.
-   However, unlike Java, Python does not restrict access to private members. Instead, it uses a concept called "name mangling" to make the attribute name more difficult to use outside the class.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_var = "This is private"

obj = MyClass()
print(obj._MyClass__private_var)  # Name mangling for private access
```

#### Protected Access (Conventional, No Strict Enforcement):

-   In Python, there is no strict enforcement of protected access.
-   Protected members are indicated by a single underscore `_` prefix before the variable or method name. This indicates that the attribute should be treated as protected, but it's not enforced.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected_var = "This is protected"

obj = MyClass()
print(obj._protected_var)  # Accessing protected_var (convention, not strict enforcement)
```

#### Comparing with Java:

-   In Java, access control modifiers like `private`, `public`, and `protected` are strictly enforced.
-   `private`: Only accessible within the same class.
-   `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
-   `protected`: Accessible within the same package and subclasses (even if they are in different packages).

**Note:** In Python, developers often follow naming conventions to indicate access levels (`_` for protected, `__` for private), but these conventions are not enforced by the language itself.

This approach in Python offers greater flexibility, emphasizing developer responsibility and avoiding rigid access restrictions. It's important to understand these concepts when transitioning from Java to Python.
