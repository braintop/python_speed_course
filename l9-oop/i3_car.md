Explanation:
Concept of Classes and Objects:

Python: In Python, classes are used to define blueprints for objects. Objects are instances of these classes, and they can hold data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
Java: In Java, classes serve a similar purpose. Objects are instances of classes, encapsulating data and methods.
Relating to Java:

In Java, you might have encountered class definitions and object instances using the class keyword. Python uses the same class keyword to define classes and create objects.
Defining a Class using class Keyword:

We define a class named Car using the class keyword, specifying its properties and methods.
The Car class has an **init** method, which serves as the constructor. It's called when a new object of the class is created.
self refers to the instance being created and allows access to its attributes and methods.
The **init** Method as a Constructor:

In Python, the **init** method initializes instance attributes when an object is created. It's similar to Java constructors.
Here, make and model are attributes of the Car class. They're assigned values passed during object creation.
Using Methods to Interact with Objects:

The get_info method is defined within the Car class. It returns a string containing car information using the instance attributes.
We create objects (car1 and car2) of the Car class and use the get_info method to obtain information.
This example demonstrates how Python uses classes and objects, similar to Java's object-oriented paradigm. The **init** method serves as the constructor, and methods within the class provide behavior for the objects.
