1. **Create Virtual Environment:**
   Use the following command to create a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv /Users/your_user/Desktop/course/python/l16/venv
    ```

2. **Activate Virtual Environment:**
   Activate the virtual environment:

    - On macOS or Linux:

        ```sh
        source /Users/asaf/Desktop/course/python/l16/venv/bin/activate
        ```

    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        /Users/asaf/Desktop/course/python/l16/venv/Scripts/activate
        ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages, including `requests`:

    ```sh
    pip install requests
    ```

4. **Run Script:**
   Run your script using the `python` command (without the version number):

    ```sh
    python l16.py
    ```

By following these steps, you should be able to create a virtual environment, activate it, and run your script using Python 3.8 (or whichever version is associated with the `python3` command).
