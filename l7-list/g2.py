# List Comprehensions:

# List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists. 
# They allow you to generate new lists by applying an expression
# to each item in an existing iterable.

squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
# Iterating Over Lists:

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
