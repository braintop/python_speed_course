Certainly! Decorators and context managers are two powerful and commonly used features in Python for modifying functions and managing resources, respectively. Here are examples for both:

### Decorators:

Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions. They are often used for tasks like logging, authentication, and memoization. Here's an example of a simple decorator that measures the execution time of a function:

```python
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Function executed")

slow_function()
```

In this example, the `measure_time` decorator calculates the time taken by the decorated function to execute. The `@measure_time` syntax is used to apply the decorator to the `slow_function`.

### Context Managers:

Context managers are used for resource management, ensuring that resources are properly acquired and released. They are often used with the `with` statement. Here's an example of a simple context manager for opening and closing a file:

```python
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.file.close()

with FileManager("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, context managers!")

# File is automatically closed when exiting the block
```

In this example, the `FileManager` class is a context manager. The `__enter__` method opens the file, and the `__exit__` method ensures that the file is closed when exiting the block.

These examples demonstrate how decorators and context managers can be used to enhance function behavior and manage resources more effectively in Python.
