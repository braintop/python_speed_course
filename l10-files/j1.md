In the code you provided for reading and writing to a file, the file permissions are set to the default permissions, which allow the file to be created, written to, and read from within the same directory where the script is executed. However, if you want to explicitly specify the file permissions, you can use the `mode` parameter when opening the file.

The `mode` parameter is a string that represents the file access mode and permission settings. Here are some common modes:

-   `'r'`: Read (default). Open the file for reading.
-   `'w'`: Write. Open the file for writing. If the file already exists, its content will be cleared. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created.
-   `'a'`: Append. Open the file for writing, but append new content to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created.
-   `'x'`: Exclusive creation. Open the file for writing, but only if the file doesn't already exist.
-   `'b'`: Binary mode. Used in combination with other modes to indicate that the file should be opened in binary mode (e.g., `'rb'` for reading binary).

Here's the same code with the default permissions, along with some notes about the permissions:

```python
# Writing to a file with default permissions ('w' mode)
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, world!\n')
    file.write('This is a sample text.')

# Reading from a file with default permissions ('r' mode)
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

In this code, the `'w'` mode allows you to write to the file (creating the file if it doesn't exist or overwriting it if it does), and the `'r'` mode allows you to read from the file.

Remember that file permissions can also be affected by the operating system's file system settings and the user's permissions. It's important to be aware of file permissions and to follow best practices for securing sensitive data.
