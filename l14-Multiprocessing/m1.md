Multiprocessing is a way to achieve parallel execution in Python by using multiple processes. Each process runs in its own separate memory space, allowing for true parallelism. Here's an example that demonstrates using the `multiprocessing` module to create and manage processes:

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def worker_function(name):
    print(f"Worker {name} started")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Worker {name} finished")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create two processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker_function, args=("Process 1",))
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker_function, args=("Process 2",))

    # Start the processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Wait for both processes to finish
    p1.join()
    p2.join()

    print("Both processes have finished")
```

In this example, two worker processes (`p1` and `p2`) are created using the `multiprocessing.Process` class. The `start` method starts the execution of the processes, and the `join` method waits for the processes to complete before moving forward.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the code inside it is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module. This is important to avoid issues with multiprocessing on certain platforms.

Multiprocessing is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from parallel execution, and it can be used to take full advantage of multi-core processors.
