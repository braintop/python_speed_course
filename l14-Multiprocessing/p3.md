Here's an example that demonstrates various functions and features of the `multiprocessing` module in Python:

```python
import multiprocessing

def worker_function(number):
    print(f"Worker {number} started")
    result = number * 2
    print(f"Worker {number} finished with result: {result}")
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Get the number of available CPU cores
    num_cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
    print(f"Number of CPU cores: {num_cores}")

    # Create a pool of worker processes
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=num_cores)

    # Map tasks to the worker processes
    tasks = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    results = pool.map(worker_function, tasks)

    # Close the pool and wait for the worker processes to finish
    pool.close()
    pool.join()

    print("All worker processes have finished.")

    # Display the results
    print("Results:", results)
```

In this example, we use the `multiprocessing` module to create a pool of worker processes, map tasks to the processes, and retrieve the results. Here are the key functions and concepts demonstrated:

1. `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`: Returns the number of available CPU cores.

2. `multiprocessing.Pool`: Creates a pool of worker processes.

3. `pool.map()`: Maps tasks to the worker processes and returns the results.

4. `pool.close()`: Closes the pool of processes.

5. `pool.join()`: Waits for all worker processes to finish.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is important to ensure that the code within it is executed only when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module. This is crucial for proper behavior when using multiprocessing.

Keep in mind that this example uses the `Pool` class for simple parallelism. For more complex scenarios and fine-grained control, you can use other features of the `multiprocessing` module.
