Certainly! Here are some of the key functions and methods of the `collections.deque` class in Python:

1. `deque(iterable, maxlen=None)`: Creates a new deque. If `maxlen` is provided, the deque will have a maximum length, and elements will be discarded from the opposite end when the maximum length is reached.

2. `append(item)`: Adds an item to the right end of the deque.

3. `appendleft(item)`: Adds an item to the left end of the deque.

4. `extend(iterable)`: Extends the deque by appending elements from the iterable to the right end.

5. `extendleft(iterable)`: Extends the deque by appending elements from the iterable to the left end.

6. `pop()`: Removes and returns an element from the right end of the deque.

7. `popleft()`: Removes and returns an element from the left end of the deque.

8. `clear()`: Removes all elements from the deque.

9. `rotate(n)`: Rotates the deque to the right by `n` steps (negative `n` rotates to the left).

10. `reverse()`: Reverses the elements of the deque in place.

11. `count(item)`: Returns the number of occurrences of `item` in the deque.

12. `index(item[, start[, stop]])`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of `item` within the specified slice.

13. `remove(item)`: Removes the first occurrence of `item` from the deque.

14. `maxlen`: Attribute that represents the maximum length of the deque (read-only).

Here's an example demonstrating some of these functions:

```python
from collections import deque

# Create a deque
deque_example = deque([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], maxlen=5)

# Append and appendleft
deque_example.append(6)
deque_example.appendleft(0)

# Extend and extendleft
deque_example.extend([7, 8])
deque_example.extendleft([-1, -2])

# Pop and popleft
popped_item = deque_example.pop()
popped_left_item = deque_example.popleft()

# Rotate
deque_example.rotate(2)

print("Deque:", deque_example)
print("Popped item:", popped_item)
print("Popped left item:", popped_left_item)
```

Keep in mind that the `collections.deque` class is a versatile data structure that combines the features of both stacks and queues. You can use it to efficiently perform operations at both ends of the sequence.
